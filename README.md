# Specialization Project
This github repository is created as a supplementary resource to my specialization project conducted during the fall of 2019. The focus of the project was to deveolope a Faster R-CNN object detection model using the Tensorflow API in order to detect and localize cores within optical core images used in the petroleum industry. This repository presents the results generated by the three models (benchmark,M1,M2) outlined in the project report. Additonally, the weights from the three models and inference graph from the final model (M2) is made available so that they can be trained further, or be used for inference. 
## Appendix
The Appendix directory contains the files mentioned in Methodology chapter of the report, the configuration files for the three models, as well as the data used. The data is provided in the formats: .jepg, .tfrecord, .xml and .csv. Additionally, the predictions on the validation set for the three models and the M2 predictions on test set is presented.

Welcome to the object detection inference walkthrough!  This notebook will walk you step by step through the process of using a pre-trained model to detect objects in an image. Make sure to follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/installation.md) before you start.
