## Specialization Project
This github repository is created as a supplementary resource to my specialization project conducted during the fall of 2019. The focus of the project was to deveolope an object detection model using the Tensorflow API in order to detect and localize cores within optical core images used in the petroleum industry.
# Appendix
The Appendix directory contains the files mentioned in Methodology chapter of the report, as well as the data


Welcome to the object detection inference walkthrough!  This notebook will walk you step by step through the process of using a pre-trained model to detect objects in an image. Make sure to follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/installation.md) before you start.
